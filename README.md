# Jelly Platforms

This is the base of a tiny proof of concept for [recreating the platforms](https://twitter.com/sugarbycukia/status/1297245967830396935?s=20) from [The Floor Is Jelly](http://thefloorisjelly.com/) in Unity. The project only includes the source of the plaform generation and sprining.

The rendering is done using [Shapes](https://acegikmo.com/shapes/) by [Freya Holm√©r](https://twitter.com/FreyaHolmer) and available on the [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/particles-effects/shapes-173167). Simply add Shapes to the project and the Polygon component to the JellyPlatform game object. 

You can create your own platforms by creating a CornerShape object and defining the corners.
